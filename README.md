# ⛽ FuelStation - Who Needs Fuel When You Have Code? 

Welcome to **FuelStation**, the revolutionary (not really) fuel marketplace that exists solely because I was bored one weekend. This project proves you can build anything with enough caffeine and questionable life choices. 


## 🛠️ Installation Guide (For the Brave)

So you want to run this masterpiece? Buckle up, buttercup. Here's how to potentially get it working:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (because what doesn't run on JavaScript these days?)
- MongoDB (for storing all those imaginary fuel transactions)
- A healthy dose of patience (you'll need it)

### 🖥️ Backend Setup (Where the Magic Doesn't Happen)

```powershell
git clone "https://github.com/mdrayaanpasha/FuelStation.git"

cd .\FuelStation\backend\

npm install

npx tsc

node .\dist\index.js

```
⚠️ Pro Tip: When you inevitably get EADDRINUSE error, just angrily kill whatever's using port 3000. Problem solved! 💥


## 💅 Frontend Setup (The Shiny Part)
```powershell

cd ..\frontend\

npm install

cd .\app\

npm i

npm run dev


```

## 🎉 Features (That Mostly Work)

- **Fake Fuel Trading** - Buy and sell imaginary fuel like a Wall Street tycoon  
- **Authentication** - Because we need to pretend this is secure  
- **Beautiful UI** - Looks great until you actually try to use it  
- **100% Bug-Free** - *This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA*  

## 🤔 Why Does This Exist?

Excellent question! Reasons include:  
- I was bored  
- I wanted to play with React and TypeScript  
- The world clearly needed another half-baked fuel marketplace  
- My cat told me to do it  

## 🚨 Known Issues

- The "Buy Fuel" button might actually just order pizza  
- Sometimes the database forgets it's supposed to work  
- The code quality ranges from "questionable" to "what was I thinking"  
- All error messages are sarcastic by design *(that's a feature, not a bug)*
